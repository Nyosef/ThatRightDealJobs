# ThatRightDeal

A repository for the ThatRightDeal project.

## Description

This repository contains the source code and resources for the ThatRightDeal project. It uses Supabase PostgreSQL as a service database for data storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
- npm (v6 or higher recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/ThatRightDeal.git
   cd ThatRightDeal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file and add your actual API keys and configuration values.

## Environment Configuration

This project uses environment variables to manage API keys and other sensitive configuration. The following steps explain how to set up your environment:

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and configuration.

3. The following environment variables are used in this project:

   - **ATTOM API**

     - `ATTOM_API_KEY`: API key for accessing ATTOM property data services

   - **Supabase Configuration**
     - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., https://xyzproject.supabase.co)
     - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key

4. The `.env` file is excluded from version control in `.gitignore` to prevent exposing sensitive information.

### About ATTOM API

The ATTOM API provides access to property data, including:

- Property characteristics
- Owner information
- Tax assessments
- Sales history
- Foreclosure data
- And more

### About Supabase

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides:

- PostgreSQL Database: A powerful, open-source relational database
- Authentication: User management and authentication
- Auto-generated APIs: Instant RESTful APIs for your database
- Storage: File storage with security rules
- Realtime: Build realtime applications

This project uses Supabase as a service database to store and retrieve data. For more information about Supabase, visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Database Setup

To use the Supabase PostgreSQL database with this project:

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) if you don't have one already.
2. Create a new Supabase project.
3. In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to Settings > API to find your project URL and anon/public key.
4. Add these values to your `.env` file as `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`.
5. Create the necessary tables in your Supabase database:

   - `api_data`: Stores data fetched from external APIs
     - Columns:
       - `id`: UUID (primary key, auto-generated)
       - `userId`: Integer
       - `title`: Text
       - `body`: Text
       - `fetched_at`: Timestamp

   You can create this table using the Supabase dashboard or with the following SQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE api_data (
     id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
     userId INTEGER,
     title TEXT,
     body TEXT,
     fetched_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
   );
   ```

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the application and test the Supabase connection
- `npm run daily-task`: Run the daily task script that fetches data and stores it in Supabase

## GitHub Actions Workflow

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the daily task automatically:

1. **Schedule**: The workflow runs daily at midnight UTC
2. **Manual Trigger**: You can also trigger the workflow manually from the Actions tab

### Setting up GitHub Secrets

To make the GitHub Actions workflow work correctly, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Add the following secrets:
   - `ATTOM_API_KEY`: Your ATTOM API key
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase anon key

These secrets will be used to create the `.env` file during the workflow execution, ensuring that both the ATTOM API and Supabase are properly configured.
